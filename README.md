## Background and program

We have been asked to develop a health incentive program that SuperLife can pair with its longer- term life insurance products. SuperLife are looking to improve its policyholdersâ€™ expected mortality once the policyholder has purchased an insurance policy. We propose a health program that includes a smoking cessation program, a weight management program and cancer prevention initiatives.

## Key insights
- The incentive programs led to a decrease in mortality and ultimately led to an increase in profits for SuperLife.

## Model \& pricing

Pricing of SuperLife's insurance products was done by considering the following characteristics of the policyholders:
- Age (10-year age group)
- Smoking status
- Sex (if the policyholder was a non-smoker)

For these differentiated groups of people, mortality and lapse rates were estimated separately using SuperLife's in-force dataset. 

Initial premiums were calculated by ensuring a profit margin of 8\%. Premium prices were not changed after the supposed implementation of our proposed program.
