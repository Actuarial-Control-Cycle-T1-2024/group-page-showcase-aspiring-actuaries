            <p>We have been asked to develop a health incentive program that SuperLife can pair with its longer- term
                life insurance products. SuperLife are looking to improve its policyholders’ expected mortality once the
                policyholder has purchased an insurance policy. We propose a health program that includes a smoking
                cessation program, a weight management program and cancer prevention initiatives.</p>

                    <h3>Smoking Cessation Program</h3>
                    <p>An incentive designed to encourage current smokers to quit was developed after an initial
                        exploratory data analysis highlighted a significant correlation between smoking and a decrease
                        in
                        expected mortality.</p>
                    <p>The incentive follows a reward-based scheme that uses progressively increasing cash incentives
                        over a 6-month term. Studies have shown that the likelihood of relapse is very high (75%) within
                        this period, and decreases after 6 months of cessation, dropping down to a 30-40% chance of
                        relapse over the next 8 years (Lee, Kim, Im, & Jang, 2021). As such, the progression-based
                        reward
                        scheme aims to help smokers through the initial 6 months (Berlin, et al., 2021).</p>
                    <p>The proposed progression scheme provides a cash reward at certain stages aimed at maximising
                        continued participation in the program, for a 6-month total of Č1,500.</p>

                    </table>

                    <p>Studies conducted in Switzerland following a similar progressive reward scheme had participants
                        on average receiving Č1,028 with 87% of participants receiving 1 reward and 48% having
                        completed all 6 months (Etter & Schmid, 2016). A survey among participants revealed that
                        participants in the incentive program were much more likely to have obtained help by themselves
                        over the internet than those that expressed quitting but were not offered the incentive program;
                        the
                        progressive nature of the program resulted in participants becoming more motivated to seek
                        resources to help complete the program.</p>

                    <p>Surveys suggest that approximately 70-90% of smokers would like to quit and participate in the
                        program (Halpern, et al., 2016). These numbers suggest that approximately 33.6%-43.2% of
                        current smokers will complete the 6-month program, with a 20%-30% probability for long-term
                        cessation. We have assumed a 25% decrease in mortality rates attributable to smoking.</p>

                    <p>In the short term, yearly participation rates and program completion rates must be monitored to
                        ensure that there is enough completion of the program such that the cost savings associated with
                        the theoretical expected decrease in mortality will justify the observed per participant cost.
                        In
                        the
                        long term, given that most SuperLife members are aged in the 40s, we can expect to observe a
                        decrease in mortality within the next 40 years. In the unlikely event that after 40 years the
                        observed
                        mortality decrease is not as large as expected, the pricing of the program will need to be
                        reviewed.</p>

                    <h3>Weight Management Program</h3>
                    <p>A weight management program is applicable to all policyholders. This way, it will affect not only
                        smokers, but non-smokers which make up approximately 94% of SuperLife’s policyholders.
                        Approximately one in three cancers are preventable (Wilson, et al., 2018) through lifestyle
                        changes
                        including weight management and diet. Not only will this program reduce policyholders’ risk of
                        cancer, but it will also reduce the risk of heart problems, blood clots and arthritis.</p>

                    <p>Our proposed weight management program will run on an app created specifically for SuperLife
                        policyholders. The SuperLife health incentive program will include:</p>

                    <p>Further, SuperLife can provide physical activity incentives, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reminding members to take a short walk every thirty minutes. This is particularly helpful

                        <li>Recommending walking tracks to members. Lumaria is rich in natural landmarks such as

                        activity each day through the app. Participation in the program may be encouraged by providing
                        members with rewards for completing tasks, for example vouchers than can be used in grocery
                        stores.</p>
                    <p>We expect that mortality will not reduce by more than the effects attributed to the smoking
                        cessation program. For non-smokers, we expect a 5% reduction in mortality from this program.</p>

                    <h3>Cancer Prevention Initiatives</h3>
                    <p>One of the main causes of death for SuperLife’s policyholders is cancer, although we are not
                        given
                        information on the type of cancer that causes deaths. Below are general early detection and
                        prevention initiatives for cancer that SuperLife can provide to their policyholders once a year,
                        at
                        relevant times.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Early detection of cancer:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inform members on how they can check their own body for signs of cancer, such
                                    as skin, breast or testicular.
                                </li>
                                <li>Encourage members to undertake cancer screenings, e.g. for bowel cancer.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>When nearing spring & summer, inform members on how to reduce their exposure to solar
                            ultra-violet radiation (Wilson, et al., 2018), such as applying sunscreen regularly, wearing
                            sun safe hats, staying in the shade and wearing polarised sunglasses.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Information will be provided to policyholders through letters sent to the members’ home addresses
                        twice per year (one for early detection initiatives and one in the spring for skin cancer
                        prevention).</p>
                    <p>For smokers, we expect that mortality will not reduce by more than that comes from the smoking
                        cessation program. For non-smokers, there are overlaps in mortality reduction through the weight
                        management program and cancer prevention initiatives. While we expect cancer prevention
                        initiatives to reduce mortality by 5% independently of the weight management program, the
                        combined effect of both means our expected additional reduction in mortality from cancer
                        prevention initiatives will be 3%.</p>

                    The smoking cessation program is a one-off cost of Č2,177.50 in the first year of policyholder
                    issue. This is a result from the Č1,500 cost to successful participants and Č677.50 as marketing
                    and setup costs. As the program is short-term, consequent costs are one-off in the short-term. The
                    cost of the weight management program is Č522.50 per program, and the cost of cancer prevention
                    initiatives is Č52.50 per policyholder. We estimate a 5% additional cost per year to maintain these
                    two programs. The costs of the entire program for smokers and non-smokers are in the table below.

                    Premiums were estimated by guaranteeing an 8% profit margin for SuperLife (before program

                    program implementation. 20-year profits before and after program implementation as well as profit
                    margins for each policy type were estimated and are shown in the tables below.

                    Although the profit margin for the 20-year term life insurance decreases under the program, profit
                    margin for SuperLife’s single-premium whole life insurance would have increased tenfold. From
                    improved mortality from the program alone, we estimate that total profit for SuperLife in the last
                    20 years would have increased from Č1.4 billion to Č5.0 billion, with a profit margin of 35%.
